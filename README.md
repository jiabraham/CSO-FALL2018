# Fall-CSO2018-C-
Computer Systems and Organizations projects implemented in C. All projects have a README which should specifically list what each entailed. Projects provided experience with pointers, strings, functions, structs, recursion, searching, sorting, file handling and all basic data structures(arrays, linked-lists, queues, stacks, trees).
