# Fall-CSO2018-C-
Computer Systems and Organizations projects implemented in C. All projects have a README which should specifically list what each entailed. Projects provided experience with arrays, pointers, strings, functions, recursion, searching, sorting, file handling and all basic data structures(linked-lists, queues, stacks, trees).
